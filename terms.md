# Order

- These terms, together with the specifics of the accompanying _Order_, govern _Customer_'s use of the _Software_.  The **Order** is either:

  - the order _Customer_ submitted through the _Account Dashboard_, for a _Product Package_ that _Provider_ offered through the _Account Dashboard_

  - the purchase order _Customer_ sent _Provider_, for a _Product Package_ that _Provider_ quoted to _Customer_

- A **Product Package** is an offer of specific **Deal Terms** from _Provider_:

  - _Hosted Software_ or _Licensed Software_

  - a **Feature Set** of _Software Features_

  - **Use Allowances**: numeric limits on use of the _Software_, such as "ten _User Accounts_", "two _Running Instances_", or "twenty _Concurrent Users_"

  - **Software Pricing**: a way to calculate **Software Fees**, such as a flat amount for a set number of _User Accounts_, an amount based on the number of _Running Instances_, or a free trial followed by a flat monthly fee

  - a **Commitment Period**: the recurring period of time, starting on the _Order_ date, when _Provider_ commits to the _Deal Terms_, such as each month, each quarter, or each year

  - a **Payment Method** such as automatic credit card charges or invoices paid by wire transfer

  - a **Billing Cycle** such as monthly or annually, on which _Customer_ will pay for use of the _Software_

  - if the _Product Package_ is for _Hosted Software_, any _Service-Level Agreement_ for the _Website_

    - **Support Terms** setting how and when _Provider_ will respond to _Support Requests_

    - **Support Pricing**: a way to calculate **Support Fees**

# Default Deal Terms

- If a _Product Package_ doesn't mention a currency for _Software Pricing_ or _Support Pricing_, the currency is United States Dollars.

- If a _Product Package_ doesn't mention a _Feature Set_, the _Feature Set_ is all _Software Features_ described in the _Documentation_ on the _Order_ date.

- If a _Product Package_ offers a _Payment Method_ that _Provider_ must start by billing _Customer_, but does not mention payment terms, payments are due within thirty calendar days of receiving each bill, with late-payment interest of 1.5%, compounded monthly.

- If a _Product Package_ includes support services, but doesn't say when _Provider_ will respond to _Support Requests_, _Provider_ will respond on _Business Days_ from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM in the time zone of _Provider's Main Office_.

If the _Order_ includes any _Service-Level Agreement_, _Provider_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account on _Notice_ and verification that it failed to provide service according to the _Service-Level Agreement_ while _Customer_ remained within the _Use Allowances_ and met its obligations under [Follow Rules About Use](#follow-rules-about-use) and [Enforce Rules About Use](#enforce-rules-about-use).  _Provider_ agrees to apply credits against _Customer_'s obligations to pay _Fees_ as soon as possible.  _Provider_ does not agree to refund any credits.

## Refund Fees for Poor Service

If _Provider_ credits _Customer_'s account under a _Service-Level Agreement_ for three months in a row, and _Customer_ ends the _Order_ during the third month, citing poor service, _Provider_ agrees to refund _Fees_ that _Customer_ paid for those three months, as well as any _Prepaid Fees_.

## Refund Prepaid Fees for Removed Features

If _Provider_ changes or removes _Software Features_ from the _Latest Version of the Software_ that were part of the _Feature Set_, substantially reducing how useful the _Software_ is to _Customer_, and _Customer_ ends the _Order_ within three calendar months of the change, citing the change, _Provider_ agrees to refund any _Prepaid Fees_.

Both sides agree that if they take control of the defense and settlement of any _Legal Claims_ covered by _Indemnification_, they will not agree to any settlements that admit fault or impose obligations on the other side without their _Permission_.

## Notice Process

Both sides agree that to give _Notice_ under these terms, the side giving _Notice_ must send by e-mail to the address the recipient given with its signature, or to a different address given later for _Notice_ going forward.  If either side finds that e-mail can't be delivered to the e-mail address given, it may give _Notice_ by registered mail to the address on file for the recipient with the state under whose laws it is organized.

## Change Process

_Customer_ agrees to make changes to the _Order_ through the _Account Dashboard_ whenever possible.
